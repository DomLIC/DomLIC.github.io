# Introduction
This is the opening paragraph which should be large and to the point

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
There are three ways to send your access token in a request.
- In an HTTP Authorization header (always works)
- In the URL query string (only works with GET requests)
- In the request body (only works for POST & PUT when body is URL-encoded)

```
this is the pre
PROTOCOL AND HOST
"https://api.minda.io"
```

# Cloud API

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## OAuth Clients
Explain what an OAuth client is

### Create an OAuth client

## Errors
## Versioning

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
